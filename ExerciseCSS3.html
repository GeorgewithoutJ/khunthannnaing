        <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/index.html" target="_blank">Climate change</a> refers to long-term shifts and alterations in temperature and weather patterns. 
        In the past century, human activities have accelerated this process due to increased emissions of <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/" target="_blank">greenhouse gases</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) has documented how rising temperatures are leading to sea-level rise and extreme weather conditions. 
        This has serious consequences for both the <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/wildlife-conservation" target="_blank">environment</a> and human societies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scientists emphasize the role of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases" target="_blank">carbon dioxide</a> and other pollutants in intensifying the greenhouse effect. 
        Without global action, the consequences could be catastrophic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Governments around the world are working on <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement" target="_blank">climate policies</a> to limit emissions and promote sustainability. 
        Organizations like the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange" target="_blank">United Nations</a> continue to push for stronger commitments.
